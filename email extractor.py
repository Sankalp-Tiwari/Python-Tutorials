I got serviced my car tiago at Autovikas Motinagar. It really pathetic service center in Delhi. Third service, car made up and down 3 times from home to service center. Car unwashed fully, bumper damaged in service center and tail light damaged during service. No remedial reply till date.

Sub:-NOT SATISFIED WITH TATA NEXONXZ+Petrol
I have purchased the vehicle in October2017.But within less tha one year its started giving me a trouble.Today it was not getting start.I have called many times on your toll free no.but they have not try to solve my problem.They have send a local crane with unauthorised local mechinic.Without any indenty card.After many efforts I have called your Chandigarh representative.Then he send the mechanic from Panchkula Agency.They took my vehicle to Panchkula Motors.
Within a peroid of less then one year TATA VEHICLE started giving me a problem.I am lucky that the vehicle was at home.If I was on road with my family I really got stucked.
Sorry to say that It was a very bad experience to buy a TATA Product.What can I accept in upcoming time.It may give me trouble anytime anywhere.
In future there is no chance of buying any PRODUCT of TATA Company.
At last again Its a very bad experience for me.

M R Associates, authorised srevice centre of TATA MOTORS at Durgapur had already wind up their business and there is no existence of M R Associates.In fact there is no Tata Motors authorised service centre at Durgapur. But in the website of Tata motors service centre, the name M R AsSociates are being displayed.This is ridiculous and surprising for a company like Tata Motors Ltd.It seems Tata Motors do not update their website and the customers get misguided.

I have taken my car Tata Indigo to SUDARSHAN motors at kon gaon Kalyan, Maharashtra for engine over heating problem. They prepared a long job sheet saying the whole engine job has to be done, Ecm/ ecu to replace & they gaurantee me after this work is done ur car will work very fine & also u will get a good average. After almost 2 months of repair work they hand over my vehicle to me . After couple of day the same problem of engine over heating started again. They have cheated me & also charged Rs. 1 lacs from me for repair work.

I need full investigation in this case & also my money back or get the complete work done with complaint or else I have to take this matter to next level.

Regards,
Jacob Shinde

I have been trying to get a offer and proforma for TATA Hexa for the past one week without any success. I feel TATA does not have the importance of customer need centric. Since your company and dealer does not seem to be interested i am forced to for a competitive brand. But request you to make your dealer and network a professional one than sitting on any offers.
